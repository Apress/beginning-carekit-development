# CareKit Release Notes


## CareKit 1.0 Release Notes

*CareKit 1.0* supports *iOS* and requires *Xcode 6.3* or later. The minimum supported *Base SDK* is *9.0*.

*CareKit 1.0* includes the following new features and enhancements.

- **Care Plan Store**

 *Contributed by [Apple Inc.](https://github.com/carekit-apple).*

  CareKit stores activities in a database called the *Care Plan Store*. This database is located at the URL provided by
      the developer. The *Care Plan Store* is encrypted using standard file-system encryption. 

  The *Care Plan Store* can store intervention and assessment activities. Each activity has a schedule that the *Care Plan Store* uses
      to create event objects. The store can be dynamically updated and modified.

- **Care Card**

 *Contributed by [Apple Inc.](https://github.com/carekit-apple).*

  *Care Card* is a view controller that displays the intervention activities for a selected date. It provides a way to track activity
      completion and user adherence. 

  A developer can modify the *Care Plan Store* by adding, removing, or modifying an activity and the *Care Card* responds by automatically
      updating the user interface.

  The mask image on the Care Card can be customized to provide a themed user experience.

- **Symptom and Measurement Tracker**

 *Contributed by [Apple Inc.](https://github.com/carekit-apple).*

  *Symptom and Measurement Tracker* is a view controller that displays the assessment activities for a selected date. It provides a way to monitor
      subjective and objective measurements.

  A developer can modify the *Care Plan Store* by adding, removing, or modifying an activity and the *Symptom and Measurement Tracker* responds by 
      automatically updating the user interface.

- **Insights Dashboard**

  *Contributed by [Apple Inc.](https://github.com/carekit-apple).*

  The *Insights Dashboard* is a view controller that displays message items, such as an alert or tip, and charts, such as the grouped
      bar chart.

  A developer can subclass the OCKInsightItem and OCKChart classes to create new message items and charts.  

- **Grouped Bar Chart**

   *Contributed by [Apple Inc.](https://github.com/carekit-apple).*

   The *Grouped Bar Chart* displays a series of data grouped into categories. The chart can be used with the *Insights Dashboard* using the
      *OCKBarChart* object, or it can be used directly using *OCKGroupedBarChartView*.

- **Connect**

  *Contributed by [Apple Inc.](https://github.com/carekit-apple).*

  *Connect* is a view controller that displays contact information for care team members, friends, and family. *Connect* supports 
      communicating with contacts through email, messaging, and phone. It also supports a user interface for sending reports that you
      can create using the Document Exporter module 

- **Document Exporter**

  *Contributed by [Apple Inc.](https://github.com/carekit-apple).*

  The *Document Exporter* module supports creating an HTML or PDF document. Although you can provide any data youâ€™d like, the intent is 
      to export data from the Care Plan Store. The exporter can display text, charts, images, and tables.

- **Sample App**

  *Contributed by [Apple Inc.](https://github.com/carekit-apple).*

  The *Sample App* (OCKSample project in CareKit's workspace) serves as a template application that combines different modules
      from the CareKit framework. It also shows how to use ResearchKit surveys and active tasks with CareKit.

- **Test App**

  *Contributed by [Apple Inc.](https://github.com/carekit-apple).*

  The *Test App* (OCKTest project in CareKit's workspace) serves as an application to test different modules and features from
      the CareKit framework.
